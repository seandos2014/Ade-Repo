# Ade-Repo: Project_Zero
# A debut solo project
# Demonstrates a banking application
# Where a bank customer can create
# As many checking accounts as they want 
# and persisted those accounts to the post-sql database
# This project demonstrates some front-end testing 
# using postman
# Also in this project
# Jetty was used as the Back-end server
# and Java was the major programming language
# There was a little bit of Java GUI using the swing-API
# The main goal is to expand this project in the nearest future.
